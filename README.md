###Main Projects###

####Final Project: Peer Tutoring Framework####

Coby Goldberg, Isaac Gluck, Aida Piccato, Leslie Bresnehan
Description:<br>
This website is designed to link student tutors and tutees, the former who are looking to provide free tutoring for a service organization, community service hours, or personal fulfilment, and the latter who want free school help from their peers. After creating a profile, a prospective tutee can search for available tutors in a given subject on a given day (with specific times), and the website will rank all the tutors who match that criteria based on proximity of address, school, and grade. My focus in this project was on user authentication, including password hashing, search engine functionability, and general backend work. The website has a front end built in bootstrap and javascript, and a python backend with mongodb data storage. The website will be launched using a DigitalOcean droplet.<br>

####Basic Question Search Engine####

Coby Goldberg, Claire Burghard, Dennis Nenov, and Sean Yip<br>
Description:<br>
This website allows a user to ask any question beginning with "who" or "where." It then renders a list of the top five possible answers to the users question, based on a the most common names or dates found in a google search query done using json, BeautifulSoup, and the google.py import. It then uses regexp to find the most common names or dates in the top hits returned by google. It is a flask based website with a front end built using Purecss.<br>

####Basic Blogging Engine####
Coby Goldberg, Claire Burghard, David Dvorkin, and Fish Milnikiewicz<br>
Description: <br>
This website allows a user to register an account and post blogs, which can be viewed by other users of the website and commented on. Each new blog post has a unique url rendered for it based on its title and author. All blog and user information is stored using mysql. It is a flask based website with a front end built using css. <br>

####API Manipulation Project####
Coby Goldberg, David Liang<br>
Description: <br>
This website allows a user to register an account from a certain country. They can then use the website to find news about their nation's currency. Alternatively, they can input an item that they wish to buy and an amount of money in their currency from a certain year. It will convert that money into US Dollars at their 2009 valuation, and find a semi-compatibly priced item on ebay for them. It was basically an experiment in api usage, using a currency deflator built by William & Mary College, the ebay api to find items online, and the google news api to find news on the currency. One issue we ran into was that the ebay api limits its returns on query's to three items, meaning oftentimes the items are not that close to the user inputted price range. It is a flask based website with a front end built using bootstrap. <br>

###Mini Projects###

<b>Carbon Emissions Analysis Website</b><ul>
<li>Coby Goldberg, Isaac Gluck</li>
<li>This website provides analysis of historical carbon emissions data, though it was mostly created to familiarize ourselves with Flask. It is a flask based website with a front end built using Purecss.</li>

<b>Name Finder</b><ul>
<li>Coby Goldberg, Angela Lin</li>
<li>This application returns a list of all the names in a series of New York Times articles, stored locally in a text file. It finds the names using regexp. It only runs through the terminal.</li>

<b>Profile Creator</b><ul>
<li>Coby Goldberg, Isaac Gluck</li>
<li>This website allows a user to create a profile and update that profile. The data is stored using MongoDB. It is a flask based website with a front end built using Bootstrap.</li>

<b>Escape Moran Game</b><ul>
<li>Coby Goldberg, Isaac Gluck</li>
<li>This game allows you to use the mouse to guide Topher Brown-Mykolyk past the patrolling Brian Moran so Topher can reach his DJ booth. Let Moran catch you and you lose. If you win, you can play a second level, in which you must reach Mississippi, and this time face a second Moran, who comes directly at you (the first Moran simply moves up and down the screen in a preset pattern). It was built using Javascript as a learning exercise.</li>
