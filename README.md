###Main Projects###

####Basic Question Search Engine####

Coby Goldberg, Claire Burghard, Dennis Nenov, and Sean Yip<br>
Description:<br>
This website allows a user to ask any question beginning with "who" or "where." It then renders a list of the top five possible answers to the users question, based on a the most common names or dates found in a google search query done using json, BeautifulSoup, and the google.py import. It then uses regexp to find the most common names or dates in the top hits returned by google. It is a flask based website with a front end built using Purecss.<br>

####API Manipulation Project####
Coby Goldberg, David Liang<br>
Description: <br>
This website allows a user to register an account from a certain country. They can then use the website to find news about their nation's currency. Alternatively, they can input an item that they wish to buy and an amount of money in their currency from a certain year. It will convert that money into US Dollars at their 2009 valuation, and find a semi-compatibly priced item on ebay for them. It was basically an experiment in api usage, using a currency deflator built by William & Mary College, the ebay api to find items online, and the google news api to find news on the currency. One issue we ran into was that the ebay api limits its returns on query's to three items, meaning oftentimes the items are not that close to the user inputted price range. It is a flask based website with a front end built using bootstrap. <br>
